## intro

this is a vintage unpowered cube, first conceived in february 2020 shortly before the release of Ikoria. it features some of the more iconic limited archetypes and cards in Magic's history. the full list is [here](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/kev).

on the strix scale, it's between **8-N** to **8-F**—just below powered cubes and relatively fast, but not quite on the level of broken mana (![Sol Ring](.)). here's what that means according to the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/c2wyta/the_strix_scale_shorthand_for_cube_power_level/) itself:

> **8**: High-quality fixing; "best-in-class" answers and threats; some fast mana.

> **N**: Aggression is well balanced and competitive in your cube. Combos are nerfed or are more interactive. Slow decks must prepare for aggro, but they won't be punished if they miss one or two early plays.

> **F**: Aggression is an essential, inseparable part of your cube. Aggro takes on multiple flavors, often in more than 2 colors. Accelerated combo kills. If slower decks don't have a solid curve or a mainboard contingency plan, they'll have no chance.

## cube primer

cube is a limited Magic format where all the cards you can draft are part of a strictly curated list. while it bears some similarity to drafting retail sets like Iconic Masters, it's often much more powerful and usually singleton, meaning each card appears only once. cube can be drafted in a variety of ways (see the [draft primer](#draft-primer) below), though most often it is done the same way as retail limited: 3 packs of 15 cards each.

after you've drafted your cards, you'll want to create a deck of minimum 40 cards, with a recommended split of 17 lands to 23 spells. this isn't a hard and fast rule, but it's a helpful guideline to adhere to. all other cards you've drafted are considered your "sideboard," and you may adjust your deck with them as you see fit between matches.

### how to draft

the simplest way to draft is by evaluating the cards and picking them in [FOCUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M6QriEbyws) order:

> **[F]ixing**: cards that fix your manabase. duals and fetches are most ideal, but even ![Fabled Passage](.) is a strong pick if nothing else.

> **[O]pen**: cards that you can easily put into your deck. most often colorless and relatively cheap, but also any colors that might be open or highly splashable cards. pretty much everyone's happy to play ![Skullclamp](.), and it's not hard to splash for ![Ponder](.).

> **[C]heat**: cards that "cheat": either literally, or enabling it with fast mana or other mechanics. notable examples include ![Channel](.), ![Tinker](.), and ![Reanimate](.), but also typical ramp spells like the signets or ![Rampant Growth](.). you might also want to evaluate tutors like ![Entomb](.) under this category, depending on what you've already drafted.

> **[U]nique**: cards that provide relatively unique and possibly irreplaceable effects, such as ![Wrath of God](. "wraths") or ![Mother of Runes](.). the more versatile, the better.

> **[S]trategy**: cards that adhere to a specific strategy or archetype. ![Pestermite](.), for example, acts more or less as a signpost for the [Twin](#kiki-jiki-splinter-twin) archetype, and is relatively useless outside of it.

the FOCUS drafting order is most important to keep in mind for your first pick of your first pack (p1p1), though it's not the be all and end all of drafting strategies. it's main advantages are being easy to keep in mind and very safe: done properly, you shouldn't have a complete dud of a deck.

alternatively, you can go for the cube-specific drafting method OSHIT by Zolthux:

> **[O]BVIOUSLY BROKEN CARD**

> **[S]IGNETS**

> **[H]IGH QUALITY LANDS**

> **[I]GNORE ALL CUTE ARCHETYPES**

> **[T]AKE ALL GOLD CARDS THAT WHEEL**

### drafting signals

> _"when neighboring drafters learn what one another are drafting, they're able to cooperate and will both wind up with better decks. This type of understanding and cooperation can be accomplished through signaling… signaling comes in the form of what cards you pass, receive, do not pass, and do not receive from your neighbors."_

> —[Reid Duke](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/lo/basics-booster-draft-2014-11-03)

during a standard booster draft, you want to pay the most attention to the people next to you. in particular, you want to both pay attention to the signals from the person passing you packs, and send strong signals to the person you're passing packs to. since you naturally want to choose the strongest card for your deck, you'll want to find out which colors or archetypes your neighbors are in, and avoid them.

signals can be tough to evaluate, especially in cube with such a wide variety of powerful limited bombs, but generally you want to keep an eye out on which colors tend to stay open in the packs you're being passed. when your pack cycles the entire pod and still has white in it, you know white's open; in the same vein, if packs you're receiving tend to be light on blue, then you know at least one person's going hard on blue, if not multiple people. it's not a bad idea to ditch an archetype from your first couple picks based on the signals you're receiving, since you want to avoid drafting the dregs from the person before you.

### quadrant theory

quadrant theory is a way to evaluate any given card on the spot. it can be helpful for limited, especially if you haven't played with the card much. the theory evaluates along the following 4 axes:

> **Opening and Developing**: how does the card perform in the opening and developing turns of the game? cards that evaluate well along this axis are typically early aggro drops, ramp, and cantrips.

> **Parity**: how does the card perform on an even board state? these are where your bombs come in. cards that evaluate well here break parity in your favor; these are your big splashy dudes, your archetype-defining permanents, and your swingy tempo drops.

> **Winning**: how does the card perform on an advantageous board state? most cards evaluate well here, since most cards ideally are there to help you win. the best cards here are the ones that close out the game fastest.

> **Losing**: how does the card perform on a disadvantageous board state? this is the axis that very few cards evaluate well in, and are highly sought-after. key combo pieces, board wipes, and strong etb creatures are typically what you're looking for here.

## archetypes

a summary of some of the more explicitly supported archetypes.

### reanimator

b + u/g/x

reanimator is one of the most iconic archetypes in magic's history, and basically aims to circumvent high mana costs by cheating them into play from the graveyard. reanimator decks play very well as combo decks in dimir colors, but can also work well in golgari midrange shells. reanimator has two key combo pieces: ![Reanimate](. "enablers"), and ![Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](. "payoffs"). cards like ![Buried Alive](.) and ![Faithless Looting](.) are great for loading your graveyard, while the 2 cmc reanimation spells like ![Exhume](.) and ![Goryo's Vengeance](.) are the abusive spells you need to cheat out big creatures.

the u/b dimir variant plays much like a combo deck; you'll want to have ![Ponder](. "cantrips") to sift through, ![Looter Il-Kor](. "looters") for card and graveyard advantage, and ![Mystical Tutor](. "tutors") to find your reanimation pieces. this also plays well with typical cheat spells like ![Tinker](.) and ![Show and Tell](.).

splashing green gives you access to fast ramp, more midrange value, and the ![Survival of the Fittest](.) / ![Fauna Shaman](.) tutor engines. this works amazingly in the ![Recurring Nightmare](.) archetype, but isn't necessary to be successful.

in general, the reanimator archetype is broad and works well with a variety of shells. when drafting, look for combo pieces, payoffs, and cards that find either of them for success. the best payoffs to reanimate are ones with immediate board presence, like ![Sundering Titan](.) and ![Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](.).

### recurring nightmare

b + u/g/x

a really fun and extremely oppressive subtype of reanimator that revolves around abusing enter the battlefield / leave the battlefield effects with ![Recurring Nightmare|EXO](.). usually you want to draft a basic midrange / control sultai shell with value creatures like ![Mulldrifter](.), ![Acidic Slime](.), ![Shriekmaw](.), etc. it helps if you can tutor up the nightmare for additional consistency, but it's surprisingly a pretty poor fit for typical reanimation shells, requiring a creature already on the board as well as costing a little more than ![Reanimate](.) or ![Animate Dead](.).

aim for mana fixing and a b/u/g shell if possible. cards that put themselves into the yard or return things from the yard to your hand are a premium, like evoke creatures or ![Eternal Witness](.). you're also looking for ![Survival of the Fittest](.) and it's stick cousin, ![Fauna Shaman](.) as both a tutor and discard outlet.

the goal for the deck is to be a decent midrange / control deck with occasional outs to nightmare, where you just run away with one of the strongest value engines in cube. nightmare is notably extremely hard to hit with removal, since sacrificing and returning it to hand are part of the cost instead of the resolution.

### wildfire

r + u/g/x

![wildfire](.) is a pretty weird deck that isn't super intuitive at first glance. it's a deck that revolves around setting up an asymmetrical wildfire or similar effect, and then racing to the bottom with either artifact mana (which is unaffected), land ramp, or just holding extra mana (playing cards out after an ![upheaval](.)). this deck is at its best if you can assemble exodia: ![Wildfire](.), ![Burning of Xinye](.), and ![Upheaval](.).

an izzet control shell really shines in this archetype, since you have access to a number of ways to both reach 6 mana safely and race to the bottom faster. it's still quite playable with green (![Rampant Growth](. "land ramp") / ![Wurmcoil Engine](. "big creatures")) or white (fast clock and access to ![Balance](.)) but it'll feel extremely swingy without a consistent way to hit your turn 6 wildfire, which means sticking to an izzet or gruul shell depending on which pieces you drafted. ![Tinker](.) shells are also not bad if you have lots of artifact ramp.

![Mystical Tutor](. "tutors") really help with the consistency of this deck. wildfire and cousins have the benefit of being searchable by most of the available tutors. it's also not a bad idea to splash black for access to ![Demonic Tutor](.) or similar.

planeswalkers are really strong with this archetype, as they're not touched by wildfire and thus help increase the asymmetrical delta after casting. on the other hand, planeswalkers are also one of the harder things to play against. ![Koth of the Hammer](. "Koth") is a notable inclusion as he gives you a strong finisher and a decent ramp. another great finisher is ![Greater Gargadon](.), who you can sac your lands (and creatures!) in advance for a 9/7 beater straight after land destruction.

### kiki-jiki / splinter twin

u/r + w

this is a fun and somewhat degenerate combo deck that's best played in a control or midrange shell with occasional outs to a game-ending infinite. if you can get both major engines (![Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](. "Kiki-Jiki") and ![Splinter Twin](.)) all you have to do is draft both ![Vendilion Clique](. "value etb pieces") and ![Zealous Conscripts](. "winning combo pieces") to build a solid deck. the salt factor of this archetype is pretty high—the combo is a special kind of degenerate—but also relatively fragile, as most instant-speed removal counterspells can put a quick stop to it.

aside from the infinite combos, kiki and twin are generally strong value engines as they can add extra etb effects and bodies. u/r is also a pretty strong color combination in general, so it's not exactly hurting for ways to win even without the combo.

the deck is helped a lot by two key tutors: ![Recruiter of the Guard](.) in white and ![Imperial Recruiter](.), who both find you either kiki or most of the combo pieces. ![Deceiver Exarch](.) is generally considered the best combo piece to search for since it's both cheap and hard to deal with, but any of them work as long as you have a way to play them. copy cards such as ![Phyrexian Metamorph](.) are also a good way of adding redundancy to the infinite.

the goal is to play as a strong combo deck using the kiki/twin win condition, with generic etb value as a backup plan. while it's best to get fixing and consistency via combo pieces or tutors, most strong etb creatures are also fine draft picks, like ![Flametongue Kavu](.) or ![Wall of Omens](.).

the major combos to note are:

- kiki/twin + ![Deceiver Exarch](.)
- kiki/twin + ![Pestermite](.)
- kiki/twin + ![Zealous Conscripts](.)
- kiki + ![Felidar Guardian](.)
- kiki + ![Restoration Angel](.)

### oath of druids

g + x

![Oath of Druids](.) is a weird and extremely powerful card to build around that you really don't want to draft unless it's early or you're already in a big cheaty archetype. it's almost always great combined with the other cheaty archetypes and very poor in most other deck types, like aggro or midrange. the key thing to note about the archetype is that you _really_ do not want creatures besides your big payoffs; in order to make the effect as asymmetrical as possible, you generally want all your hits to be big and immediate impact.

oath alone is pretty inconsistent, but it goes great with the general temur strategy of cheat things out; along with ![Sneak Attack](. "sneak") and ![Show and Tell](. "show"), it can be a pretty strong deck with a lot of different ways to play fatties. ![Sneak Attack](.) is especially strong with oath, since it doesn't leave behind a creature for your upkeep. you also want to look for ![Forbidden Orchard](.), a land which ensures you get your oath triggers and provides strong mana fixing.

green ramp is a decent shell since it gives you access to ![Tooth and Nail](.) and ![Green Sun's Zenith](.), both of which are relatively weak but good mana sinks if you haven't drawn into oath. ironically, you do want to avoid ![Gaea's Cradle](. "cradle"), since you want to have as few creatures as possible - but ![Tolarian Academy](.) and artifact ramp are easy draft picks.

oath works very well with planeswalkers, especially as a way to buffer your life while you try to draw into any of your power pieces. the manland creating planeswalkers like ![Koth of the Hammer](. "Koth") can be useful for this since most of them return to being lands at end of turn, preventing you from missing out on oath effects.

drafting oath is difficult, since it's incompatible with pretty much everything but the other big cheaty archetypes. unlike the nightmare archetype, you can't really hope to win without drawing into your cheat spells, but it can lead to some explosive games very quickly.

### sneak and show

u/r + g

a powerful cheaty archetype primarily focused in izzet colors. the main stars are ![Sneak Attack](.) and ![Show and Tell](.), both of which want to cheat out large and broken creatures like ![Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](. "Eldrazi") or ![Grave Titan](. "titans"). with access to green, you can have some level of redundancy and access to ![Survival of the Fittest](.) / ![Fauna Shaman](.), who can help load your hand with the correct fatties. as noted in the oath section, ![Oath of Druids](.) is also a strong draft pick, though it comes with some deck building restrictions.

![sneak attack](.) is the real haymaker of the deck, and a sneak attack on curve can be back-breaking with a good payoff in hand: it's hard to interact with and provides a consistent way to cheat out big creatures. ![show and tell](.) aims to be asymmetrical, but can potentially backfire. playing this on curve is generally best, but there's no guarantee that you're the only one cheating something out when you cast it.

additional redundancy is provided by ![Through the Breach](.), which has a lower ceiling than the titular cards of the archetype but doesn't have quite the same worst case scenario. it serves as a stopgap measure if you haven't drawn into either of the two titular combo pieces, or had them countered / discarded somehow. you can also try to incorporate ![Tinker](.), though it requires an artifact on the board in addition to a cheat target in hand.

generally you want to draft the enablers (sneak and show, oath, etc...) before payoffs, but some payoffs are generically good payoffs in multiple decks (specifically, artifact creatures that can hit the yard and be tinkered out). it's not a bad idea to early pick ![Sundering Titan](.) or ![Sphinx of the Steel Wind](.) with the plan to look out for ways to cheat them early, either via temur cheat or reanimator.

## draft primer

standard booster drafting is really simple: with 3 packs of 15 cards each, draft a single card from your pack, then pass it to the next person along the table. this typically goes left, right, left. each player ends up with 45 cards, and if you have 8 players (a full pod), then you will see 360 cards total, with any given person seeing 276 total cards.

standard sealed drafting is just as simple, though limited to 4 players at most. each player receives a pool of 90 cards (equivalent to 6 booster packs) from which to craft their deck.

### shuffling

shuffling is hard. i use the [moak0 shuffling method](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/34fet8/novel_method_for_shuffling_a_cube/):

1. organize cards into each color (w/u/b/r/g) and a sixth "rest of the cards" pile.
2. move cards from each color into the sixth pile until there is 10% of the cube count in each colored pile (i.e. 36 cards in each colored pile for 360 cube)
3. shuffle the sixth pile however you please.
4. distribute cards from the sixth pile evenly back into each colored pile. each colored pile should have 20% of the cube count now (i.e. 72 cards for 360 cube)
5. construct packs evenly from each pile. for standard booster draft, that's 3 cards from each pile.

### two-player draft formats

the vast majority of these are sourced from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/5jbaqn/cube_draft_format_primer/).

**winston draft**

1. Make a single deck of 90 cards.
2. Choose someone to draft first, then put the top three cards from the deck face down next to it as three new small piles of one card each.

3. The first player looks at the first small pile. That player may choose to draft that pile or not:

   - If that player drafts it, he or she replaces that pile with a new face-down card from the deck.

   - If that player doesn't draft it, he or she puts it back and adds a new card from the deck (face-down), and moves on to the next pile, where this process is repeated.

   - If the first player arrives at the third pile and does not want to draft it, he or she adds a card to it (face-down), then drafts a random card from the top of the deck.

4. One the first player has drafted from a small pile or from the top of the deck, it becomes the second player’s turn to draft.

5. Continue alternating until all 90 cards have been drafted.

**winchester draft**

1. Each player makes a deck of 42 cards each. Decide which player will draft first.
2. Simultaneously, each player takes the top two cards from his or her deck and lays each in their own pile.
3. The first player will draft one of these four piles.
4. Once a card is drafted, each player will simultaneously take the top two cards from his or her deck and lay each on the four existing piles—in doing so, he or she will be replenishing the pile taken with a new card and adding an additional card to each of the other piles (lay them out in order, don't look at the cards and decide where each one should go).
5. The next player will draft one of these four piles.
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until both decks and all piles have been drafted.

**grid draft**

1. Make 18 packs of 9 cards each.
2. Lay a pack face-up in a 3x3 grid (lay them out in order, don't look at the cards and decide where each one should go).
3. The first player drafts a row or column.
4. The second player drafts a remaining row or column. This will be either two or three cards, depending on how the first player drafted. Discard the undrafted cards, which will be 3 or 4 cards per pack.
5. Alternate who picks first from each pack until all packs have been drafted.

**solomon draft**

1. Make 10 packs of 9 cards each.
2. Lay a pack face-up on the table. A player will separate this pack into two piles. The piles do not need to be even (for example, you could have a pile of 1 and a pile of 8).
3. The other player will draft one of these piles.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, alternating players until all packs have been drafted.

**lawyer draft**

1. Make a deck of 128 cards. (note: counting is not necessary; you can just draft from the top of your cube to save time)
2. Lay the top 6 cards on the table face up.
3. The first player may either add a face-up card to their hand or add an unknown card from the top of the deck to their hand. If a face-up card is added to a hand, replace it with a card from the top of the deck (this rule will apply throughout the drafting process).
4. The second player may either add a face-up card to their hand or add an unknown card from the top of the deck to their hand.

5. Now, players have three options:

   a. Add a face-up card to their hand

   b. Add an unknown card from the top of the deck to their hand

   c. Exchange a card in their hand for a face-up card and add an unknown card from the top of the deck to their hand

6. Repeat this process, alternating players until each player has 5 cards in their hand. Each player will then draft those 5 cards (setting them aside in their card pool--they may no longer exchanged). Discard all remaining face-up cards.

7. Repeat step 6 until the entire deck is drafted/discarded (8 rounds).

### three-player draft formats

**continuous draft**

1. Make single deck of 132 cards.
2. Lay four cards face-up on the table.
3. A player will draft one of these four cards. The next player will draft two of the remaining three cards. The final player will draft the remaining card.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire deck is drafted, rotating who drafts first each round.

**three-player solomon draft**

1. Make 9 packs of 15 cards each.
2. The first player lays out 15 cards face-up and separates them into two piles. The piles do not need to be even.
3. The second player selects one of the piles. Both the first and the second player separate their piles into 3 smaller piles each. The piles do not need to be even.
4. The third player drafts one smaller pile from each of the first two players (two small piles total). The first two players retain (draft) the undrafted smaller piles.
5. Rotate draft order and repeat until all packs have been drafted.

### four-player draft formats

**four-player grid draft**

1. Make 16 packs of 15 cards each.
2. At the start of each pack, lay out the first 9 cards in a 3x3 grid face-up.
3. The first player drafts a row or column. Then, replace the drafted cards in the grid with three cards from the same pack.
4. The second player drafts a row or column. After the second player selects a row or column, replace those cards with the remaining three cards from the pack.
5. The third player drafts a row or column.
6. The fourth player drafts a remaining row or column. This will be either two or three cards, depending on how the first player drafted. Discard the undrafted cards, which will be 3 or 4 cards per pack.
7. The player who chose their cards last in one pack chooses first in the next pack.
8. After 8 packs, change the drafting rotation (from clockwise to counter-clockwise).
9. Continue until all packs have been drafted.

**tenchester draft**

1. Make 36 packs of 10 cards each.
2. Each player takes a pack, drafts a card, and passes the remaining 9 cards to their left, continued until each player has drafted a card from each pack.
3. Then, pass the 6-card packs to the drafter who started with them. Drafters can then examine the pack's contents before discarding them. (They do not select a second card from the pack).
4. Each player takes a new pack, and the order of drafting is reversed.
5. Continue until all packs have been drafted.

**minesweeper draft** [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wro62jEgjm0)

1. Lay out a 9x10 grid of cards, with the outer ring and middle 2 cards face up and the rest face down.
2. The first player drafts any face up card, flipping over any face down cards directly adjacent to it.
3. Repeat for each player until everyone has drafted 9 cards.
4. Repeat 3 more times (4 total), reversing the draft order each time. Each player should have 36 cards total.

### other draft formats

**rochester draft**

1. Make 3 packs of 15 cards each per player. Give each player three packs.
2. The first player lays his or her pack face up on the table. That player drafts one card.
3. The next player in clockwise order drafts one card. Repeat this process until the last player is reached.
4. Once the last player is reached, that player may draft two total cards from the pack.
5. Draft order is reversed, until the pack has been completely drafted.
6. The second player lays out his or her pack on the table, repeating steps 2 through 5.
7. Repeat this process until all players have drafted their first pack. Then, reverse draft order (clockwise to counterclockwise). Once all players have drafted their second pack (each player should have one pack remaining), reverse draft order again.
8. Continue until all packs have been drafted.

**rotisserie draft**

1. Lay the entire cube face-up on the table.
2. Players rotate drafting one card at a time from the available cube.
3. Continue until each player has drafted 45 cards or the cube is exhausted.

**team draft**

1. Assign players into two teams of an equal number of players.
2. Sit in alternating draft positions (the players to your left and right should be on the opposite team).
3. Make 3 packs of 15 cards each per player. Give each player three packs.
4. Proceed with normal drafting rules.

**glimpse draft**

the numbers can be adjusted to fit the number of players and the size of the cube. this is for 4 players and at least a 360 cube.

1. Make 6 packs per player of 15 cards each.
2. Each player takes one pack and drafts a card from it.
3. Each player discards 1 card from their pack (removing them from the draft entirely). Then, each player passes the pack to their left.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until both packs are entirely drafted/discarded.
5. Repeat for each pack, alternating the direction players pass packs.

## etc.

### design goals

currently, it features similar themes to most vintage powered 360 cubes. i made a conscious decision to stay away from cards that are hard to deal with and relatively unfun if you happen to get hosed (![Sword of Fire and Ice](. "swords"), ![True-Name Nemesis](. "TNN"), etc...)

i'm also not running honorary power (some of which are higher picks than power), like ![Mana Crypt](.) and ![Sol Ring](.). i had them in an earlier version of cube and they're a special kind of unfun to play against.

currently running a handful of "feel bad" cards: ![Balance](.) and ![Channel](.). both are big candidates for culling ("obviously broken"). we'll see where i end up with these two cards in the future, though they've been pretty interesting so far.

i likely won't be increasing the size of the cube pretty much ever, since i like the constraints of a smaller cube along with being much easier to get ready for play. it's already a huge pain in the ass shuffling 360 cards, let alone 450 or 540.
