## intro

this is a vintage unpowered cube, first conceived in february 2020 shortly before the release of mystery booster and ikoria. currently, it supports some of the strongest limited archetypes and features some of the most iconic cards in Magic's history.

on the strix scale, it's between **8-N** to **8-F** - just below powered cubes and relatively fast, but not quite on the level of broken mana (![Sol Ring]()) or overwhelming aggro support. here's what that means according to the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/c2wyta/the_strix_scale_shorthand_for_cube_power_level/) itself:

> **8**: High-quality fixing; "best-in-class" answers and threats; some fast mana.

> **N**: Aggression is well balanced and competitive in your cube. Combos are nerfed or are more interactive. Slow decks must prepare for aggro, but they won't be punished if they miss one or two early plays.

> **F**: Aggression is an essential, inseparable part of your cube. Aggro takes on multiple flavors, often in more than 2 colors. Accelerated combo kills. If slower decks don't have a solid curve or a mainboard contingency plan, they'll have no chance.
