# kev's cube

---

## intro

this is a vintage unpowered cube, first conceived in february 2020 shortly before the release of mystery booster and ikoria. currently, it supports some of the strongest limited archetypes and features some of the most iconic cards in Magic's history.

on the strix scale, it's between **8-N** to **8-F** - just below powered cubes and relatively fast, but not quite on the level of broken mana (![Sol Ring]()) or overwhelming aggro support. here's what that means according to the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/c2wyta/the_strix_scale_shorthand_for_cube_power_level/) itself:

> **8**: High-quality fixing; "best-in-class" answers and threats; some fast mana.

> **N**: Aggression is well balanced and competitive in your cube. Combos are nerfed or are more interactive. Slow decks must prepare for aggro, but they won't be punished if they miss one or two early plays.

> **F**: Aggression is an essential, inseparable part of your cube. Aggro takes on multiple flavors, often in more than 2 colors. Accelerated combo kills. If slower decks don't have a solid curve or a mainboard contingency plan, they'll have no chance.

## how to draft

cube is a limited Magic format where all the cards you can "pull" in your "packs" are part of a strictly curated list. while it bears some similarity to drafting retail sets like Iconic Masters, it's much tighter: in a cube of 360 cards, a pod of 8 people drafting 3 boosters of 15 cards each will see every single card, which means you can start and end the draft with some assurances about what cards have been picked or seen. this also helps keep certain archetypes viable.

standard booster drafting is really simple: with 3 packs of 15 cards each, draft a single card from your pack, then pass it to the next person along the table. this typically goes left, right, left.

### drafting order

the simplest way to draft is by evaluating the cards and picking them in [FOCUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M6QriEbyws) order:

> **[F]ixing**: cards that fix your manabase. duals and fetches are most ideal, but even ![Fabled Passage]() is a strong pick if nothing else.

> **[O]pen**: cards that you can easily put into your deck. most often colorless and relatively cheap, but also any colors that might be open or highly splashable cards. pretty much everyone's happy to play ![Skullclamp](), and it's not hard to splash for ![Ponder]().

> **[C]heat**: cards that "cheat": either literally, or enabling it with fast mana or other mechanics. notable examples include ![Channel](), ![Tinker](), and ![Reanimate](), but also typical ramp spells like the signets or ![Rampant Growth](). you might also want to evaluate tutors like ![Entomb]() under this category, depending on what you've already drafted.

> **[U]nique**: cards that provide relatively unique and possibly irreplaceable effects, such as wraths (board wipe) or ![Mother of Runes]() (protection on a stick). the more versatile it is, the better it evaluates here.

> **[S]trategy**: cards that adhere to a specific strategy or archetype. ![Pestermite](), for example, acts more or less as a signpost for the Twin archetype, and is relatively useless outside of it.

the FOCUS drafting order is most important to keep in mind for your first pick of your first pack (p1p1), though it's not the be all and end all of drafting strategies. it's main advantages are being easy to keep in mind and very safe: done properly, you shouldn't have a complete dud of a deck.

alternatively, you can go for the cube-specific drafting method OSHIT, by Zolthux:

> **[O]BVIOUSLY BROKEN CARD**

> **[S]IGNETS**

> **[H]IGH QUALITY LANDS**

> **[I]GNORE ALL CUTE ARCHETYPES**

> **[T]AKE ALL GOLD CARDS THAT WHEEL**

### drafting signals

when you do a booster draft, you want to pay the most attention to the people next to you; they are your friends. in particular, you want to both pay attention to the signals from the person passing you packs, and send strong signals to the person you're passing packs to. the cards you receive and pass on are your signals; since you naturally want to choose the strongest card for your deck, you'll want to find out which colors your friends are in, and avoid them.

signals can be tough to evaluate, especially in cube with such a wide variety of powerful limited bombs, but generally you want to keep an eye out on which colors tend to stay open in the packs you're being passed. when your pack cycles the entire pod and still has white in it, you know white's open; in the same vein, if packs you're receiving tend to be light on blue, then you know at least one person's going hard on blue, if not multiple people. it's not a bad idea to ditch an archetype from your first couple picks based on the signals you're receiving, since you want to avoid drafting the dregs from the person before you.

### card evaluation: quadrant theory

quadrant theory is a way to evaluate any given card on the spot. it's very helpful for limited and especially if you haven't played with the card much. essentially, you want to evaluate along the following 4 axes:

> **Opening and Developing**: how does the card perform in the opening and developing turns of the game? cards that evaluate well along this axis are typically early aggro drops, ramp, and cantrips.

> **Parity**: how does the card perform on an even board state? these are where your bombs come in. cards that evaluate well here break parity in your favor; these are your big splashy dudes, your archetype-defining permanents, and your swingy tempo drops.

> **Winning**: how does the card perform on an advantageous board state? most cards evaluate well here, since most cards ideally are there to help you win. the best cards here are the ones that close out the game fastest.

> **Losing**: how does the card perform on a disadvantageous board state? this is the axis that very few cards evaluate well in, and are highly sought-after bombs. key combo pieces, board wipes, and strong etb creatures are typically what you're looking for here.

## archetypes

a summary of most of the explicitly supported archetypes.

### recurring nightmare

b + u/g/x

a really fun and potentially extremely oppressive deck that revolves around abusing enter the battlefield / leave the battlefield effects with ![Recurring Nightmare|EXO](). usually you want to draft a basic midrange / control sultai shell with value creatures like ![Mulldrifter](), ![Acidic Slime](), ![Shriekmaw](), etc. it helps if you can tutor up the nightmare for additional consistency, but it's surprisingly a pretty poor fit for typical reanimation shells, requiring a creature already on the board as well as costing a little more than ![Reanimate]() or ![Animate Dead]().

aim for mana fixing and a b/u/g shell if possible. cards that put themselves into the yard or return things from the yard to your hand are a premium, like evoke creatures or ![Eternal Witness](). you're also looking for ![Survival of the Fittest]() and it's stick cousin, ![Fauna Shaman]() as both a tutor and discard outlet.

the goal for the deck is to be a decent midrange / control deck with occasional outs to Recurring Nightmare, where you just run away with one of the strongest value engines in cube. nightmare is notably extremely hard to hit with removal, since sacrificing and returning it to hand are part of the cost instead of the resolution.

### wildfire

r + u/g/x

wildfire is a pretty weird deck that isn't super intuitive at first glance. it's a deck that revolves around setting up an asymmetrical wildfire or similar effect, and then racing to the bottom with either artifact mana (which is unaffected), land ramp, or just holding extra mana (playing cards out after an upheaval). this deck shines if you can get the exodia of wildfire pieces: Wildfire, Burning of Xinye, and Upheaval.

an izzet control shell really shines in this archetype, since you have access to a number of ways to both reach 6 mana safely and race to the bottom faster. it's still quite playable with green (land ramp / stompy creatures that survive) or white (fast clock and access to Balance) but it'll feel extremely swingy without a consistent way to hit your turn 6 wildfire, which means sticking to an izzet or gruul shell depending on which pieces you drafted.

tutors really help with the consistency of this deck. Wildfire and cousins have the benefit of being searchable by most of the available tutors, which is a big increase to its consistency. it's also not a bad idea to splash black for access to Demonic Tutor and its cousins.

planeswalkers are really strong with this archetype, as they're not touched by wildfire and thus help increase the asymmetrical delta after casting. on the other hand, planeswalkers are also one of the harder things to deal with. Koth of the Hammer is a notable inclusion as he gives you a strong finisher and a decent ramp. another strong finisher is Greater Gargadon, who you can sac your lands (and creatures!) in advance to for a 9/7 beater straight after. Tinker variants are also not bad if you go into artifact ramp.

the cards that define this archetype are fairly narrow, and you generally only want to try drafting these decks if you see any of them in the first 3 picks.

### kiki-jiki / splinter twin

u/r + w

this is a fun and somewhat degenerate combo deck that seems to be best played in a control or midrange shell with outs to a game ending infinite. if you can get both major engines (Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and Splinter Twin) all you have to do is draft both value etb pieces and winning combo pieces to build a solid deck. the salt factor of this archetype is pretty high, since the combo is a special kind of degenerate but also relatively fragile, as most instant-speed removal and all counterspells can put a quick stop to it.

aside from the infinite combos, kiki and twin are generally strong value plays as they can add extra etb effects and bodies. u/r is also a pretty strong color combination in general, so it's not exactly hurting for ways to win.

the deck is helped a lot by two key tutors: Recruiter of the Guard in white and Imperial Recruiter, who both find you either kiki or most of the combo pieces. Deceiver Exarch is the best one since it's cheap and hard to deal with, but any of them work as long as you have a way to play them. copy cards such as Phyrexian Metamorph are also a good way of adding redundancy to the infinite.

the goal is to play as a strong combo deck using the kiki/twin win condition, with the occasional out to generic etb value abuse. while it's best to get fixing and consistency via combo pieces or tutors, most strong etb creatures are also fine draft picks, like Flametongue Kavu or Wall of Omens.

the major combos are:
kiki/twin + Deceiver Exarch
kiki/twin + Pestermite
kiki/twin + Zealous Conscripts
kiki + Felidar Guardian
kiki + Restoration Angel

### oath of druids

g + x

Oath of Druids is a weird and extremely powerful card to build around that you really don't want to draft unless it's early or you're already in a big cheaty archetype. it's almost always great combined with the other cheaty archetypes and very poor in most other deck types, like aggro or midrange. the key thing to note about oath of druids is that you really do not want creatures besides your big payoffs; in order to make the effect as asymmetrical as possible, you generally want all your hits to be big and immediate impact.

oath alone is pretty inconsistent, but it goes great with the general temur strategy of cheat things out; along with sneak and show, it can be a pretty strong deck with a lot of different ways to play fatties. Sneak Attack is especially strong with oath, since it doesn't leave behind a creature for your upkeep. you also want to look for Forbidden Orchard, a land which ensures you get your oath triggers and provides overall mana fixing.

green ramp is a decent shell since it gives you access to Tooth and Nail and Green Sun's Zenith, both of which are relatively weak but good mana sinks if you haven't drawn into oath. ironically, you do want to avoid Gaea's Cradle, since you want to have as few creatures as possible - but Tolarian Academy and artifact ramp is welcome.

oath works very well with planeswalkers, especially as a way to buffer your hp while you try to draw into any of your power pieces. the manland creating planeswalkers like Koth of the Hammer and Nissa, Worldwaker can be useful for this since most of them return to being lands at end of turn, preventing you from missing out on oath effects.

drafting oath is difficult, since it's incompatible with pretty much everything but the other big cheaty archetypes. unlike the nightmare archetype, you can't really hope to win without drawing into your cheat spells.

### sneak and show

u/r + g

a really strong cheaty archetype primarily focused in izzet colors. the main stars are Sneak Attack and Show and Tell, both of which want to cheat out large and fundamentally broken creatures like eldrazi or titans. with access to green, you can have some level of redundancy and access to Survival of the Fittest / Fauna Shaman, who can help load your hand with the correct fatties. as noted in the oath section, Oath of Druids is also a strong contender, though it comes with some deck building restrictions.

sneak attack is the real haymaker of the deck, and a sneak attack on curve can be back breaking with a payoff in hand. it's hard to interact with and provides a consistent way to cheat out big creatures. show and tell aims to be asymmetrical, but can notably backfire big time. playing this on curve is generally best, but there's not actually any guarantee that you're the only one cheating something out when you cast it.

additional redundancy is provided by Through the Breach, which is a lower ceiling than the titular cards of the archetype but doesn't have quite the same worst case scenario of letting your opponent cheat out something just as big. it serves as a stopgap measure if you haven't drawn into either of the two, or had them countered / discarded somehow. you can also try to incorporate Tinker, though it requires an artifact on the board and a cheat target in hand.

generally you want to draft the enablers (sneak and show, oath, etc...) before payoffs, but some payoffs are generically good payoffs in multiple decks (notably artifact creatures that can hit the yard and be tinkered out). i don't think it's a bad idea to early pick Sundering Titan or Sphinx of the Steel Wind with the plan to look out for ways to cheat them early, either via temur cheat or reanimator.

## etc.

### design goals

currently, it strongly features similar themes to vintage powered 360 cubes. i made a conscious decisiont to stay away from cards that are hard to deal with and relatively unfun if you happen to get hosed (swords, TNN, etc...)

also not running honorary power (some of which are higher picks than power even), like ![Mana Crypt]() and ![Sol Ring](). i had them in an earlier version of cube and they're kind of unfun to play against.

currently running a handful of "feel bad" cards: ![Balance]() and ![Channel](). both are big candidates for culling ("obviously broken"). we'll see where i end up with these two cards in the future, though they've been pretty interesting so far.
