# kev's cube

## intro

this is a vintage unpowered cube, first conceived in february 2020 shortly before the release of mystery booster and ikoria. currently, it supports some of the strongest limited archetypes and features some of the most iconic cards in Magic's history.

on the strix scale, it's between **8-N** to **8-F** - just below powered cubes and relatively fast, but not quite on the level of broken mana (![Sol Ring]()) or overwhelming aggro support. here's what that means according to the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/comments/c2wyta/the_strix_scale_shorthand_for_cube_power_level/) itself:

> **8**: High-quality fixing; "best-in-class" answers and threats; some fast mana.

> **N**: Aggression is well balanced and competitive in your cube. Combos are nerfed or are more interactive. Slow decks must prepare for aggro, but they won't be punished if they miss one or two early plays.

> **F**: Aggression is an essential, inseparable part of your cube. Aggro takes on multiple flavors, often in more than 2 colors. Accelerated combo kills. If slower decks don't have a solid curve or a mainboard contingency plan, they'll have no chance.

## how to draft

cube is a limited Magic format where all the cards you can "pull" in your "packs" are part of a strictly curated list. while it bears some similarity to drafting retail sets like Iconic Masters, it's much tighter: in a cube of 360 cards, a pod of 8 people drafting 3 boosters of 15 cards each will see every single card, which means you can start and end the draft with some assurances about what cards have been picked or seen. this also helps keep certain archetypes viable.

standard booster drafting is really simple: with 3 packs of 15 cards each, draft a single card from your pack, then pass it to the next person along the table. this typically goes left, right, left.

### drafting order

the simplest way to draft is by evaluating the cards and picking them in [FOCUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M6QriEbyws) order:

> **[F]ixing**: cards that fix your manabase. duals and fetches are most ideal, but even ![Fabled Passage]() is a strong pick if nothing else.

> **[O]pen**: cards that you can easily put into your deck. most often colorless and relatively cheap, but also any colors that might be open or highly splashable cards. pretty much everyone's happy to play ![Skullclamp](), and it's not hard to splash for ![Ponder]().

> **[C]heat**: cards that "cheat": either literally, or enabling it with fast mana or other mechanics. notable examples include ![Channel](), ![Tinker](), and ![Reanimate](), but also typical ramp spells like the signets or ![Rampant Growth](). you might also want to evaluate tutors like ![Entomb]() under this category, depending on what you've already drafted.

> **[U]nique**: cards that provide relatively unique and possibly irreplaceable effects, such as wraths (board wipe) or ![Mother of Runes]() (protection on a stick). the more versatile it is, the better it evaluates here.

> **[S]trategy**: cards that adhere to a specific strategy or archetype. ![Pestermite](), for example, acts more or less as a signpost for the Twin archetype, and is relatively useless outside of it.

the FOCUS drafting order is most important to keep in mind for your first pick of your first pack (p1p1), though it's not the be all and end all of drafting strategies. it's main advantages are being easy to keep in mind and very safe: done properly, you shouldn't have a complete dud of a deck.

alternatively, you can go for the cube-specific drafting method OSHIT, by Zolthux:

> **[O]BVIOUSLY BROKEN CARD**

> **[S]IGNETS**

> **[H]IGH QUALITY LANDS**

> **[I]GNORE ALL CUTE ARCHETYPES**

> **[T]AKE ALL GOLD CARDS THAT WHEEL**
